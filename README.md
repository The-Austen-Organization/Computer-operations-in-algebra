# Computer-operations-in-algebra
This repository has a list of computer operations described un the form of algebra. Our goal is to create a list of operations that allow people to program in even in the simples calculators, our goal is to be able to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponent and roots to replicate programming but in a scientific calculator withouth the programming feature. Part of there algorithms rely on Casio calculators 10 digit limit for accuracy. For this to work you need to set up your casio calculator to round for 9 decimal places. Depending on you calculator the instruction may vary, but if you know were everything is you can achive this, go to `fix`, then click 9 for the most accuracy while making sure the program works. If you do a very small operation the calculator will not display it in standard form but the accuracy is still there.
